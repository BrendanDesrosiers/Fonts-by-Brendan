# Fonts by Brendan
This is simply a collection of all the fonts I have made.

# Florp
* Currently the only font I have created and published here.
* Made using [Aseprite](https://www.aseprite.org/), a popular pixel art software, and [Yal's Pixel Font Converter](https://yal.cc/tools/pixel-font/), a neat webtool developed by YellowAfterlife (Vadym Diachenko)
